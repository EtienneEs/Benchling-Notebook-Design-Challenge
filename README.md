## Aim

The aim of this project is to develop a potential backend design for [Benchling notebook](https://www.benchling.com/notebook/).


## Challenge

- Highly scalable
- Loads of data, and potentially new file formats + features with it
- ability to leverage microservices and embed other applications into the notebook like plasmid viewers, protein model viewers, sequencing views etc.

## Backend Architecture Design

Containerization for improved stability and scalability.
Microservice like architecture pattern to allow more flexibility.
Test driven development for improved stability and easier release of new features.

## Database Schema

### Example of models.py
